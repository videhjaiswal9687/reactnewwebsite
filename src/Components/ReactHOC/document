A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic.
A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

Syntax:-
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);

example: 
const SkilledStudent = withIntern(Student) {training}
         or
const SkilledStudent = (Student) => {training}
